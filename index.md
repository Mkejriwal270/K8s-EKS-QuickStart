## How to run your apps on EKS with just a few clicks

So it’s 2021 & everyone wants to push their apps to Kubernetes. But let’s face it, this is still unknown territory for a lot of teams, especially those trying to modernise their existing apps. Also, having to go through endless tutorials & blogs, just for getting started, can be daunting. Although there is Minikube & similar tools out there, but often, enterprise cloud environments & their constraints are hard to replicate locally.

Not anymore, though!

This solution enables you to start deploying and testing your application on Amazon’s Elastic Kubernetes Service with practically zero knowledge of the underlying architecture. All you need is an AWS Account, an IAM Admin User, & your source code with its Dockerfile, & that’s it.  With just a few clicks, you will be good to go without having to install any extra utilities or dependencies locally, as your repo will do that for you. 

More on that later, let’s get started.
